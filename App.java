 Project : 3D Tic Tac Toe
 
 3D Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Qubic or 4x4x4 Tic-Tac-Toe, is a three-dimensional variation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. 
 The game is played on a 4x4x4 cubic grid, creating a total of 64 individual cells. 
 The objective is similar to traditional Tic-Tac-Toe: players strive to align four of their markers in a row in any 
 directionâ€”horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
